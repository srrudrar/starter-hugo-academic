Predictive coding is a theoretical framework in which the brain compares a generative model to incoming sensory signals. This hypothesis has been extensively employed to explain perceptual and cognitive phenomena, and has inspired computational models. There is little understanding, however, of how predictive coding might be implemented at a mechanistic level in individual neurons within the auditory system.
