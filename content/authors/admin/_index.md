Hello, I'm Srihita!

I am a PhD Candidate in Psychology at UC San Diego. I am broadly interested in in the computational neuroscience of perceptual and cognitive phenomena, in particular how sensory systems extract information from complex (real world) signals. I apply machine learning techniques and mathematical concepts to neuroscience questions that explore Predictive Coding, a theoretical framework in which the brain compares a generative model to incoming sensory signals. My thesis work uses quantitative predictive coding models, implemented at a mechanistic level, to understand sensory representations, internal models, and the dynamics of computations that relate them in populations of single auditory neurons of songbirds.

You can find out more in my {{< staticref "uploads/SrihitaRudraraju_Resume.pdf" "newtab" >}}resume{{< /staticref >}} and {{< staticref "uploads/SrihitaRudraraju_CV_21.pdf" "newtab" >}}CV{{< /staticref >}}, or our [lab website](http://gentnerlab.ucsd.edu/).
