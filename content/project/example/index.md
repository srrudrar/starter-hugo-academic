PC, a theoretical framework in which the brain compares a generative model to incoming sensory signals, has been employed to explain perceptual and cognitive phenomena, and has inspired computational models. There is little understanding, however, of how PC might be implemented at a mechanistic level in individual neurons within the auditory system.
